## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(factoextra)
```
#reading in rds files
```{r}
averageTimeOn <- read_rds("average_speed_intervals.rds")
taxiAnalysis <- read_rds("TaxiRiskAnalysis.rds")
averageTimeOn
taxiAnalysis
```
#getting the time spent on from the table by removing the time spent off from the dataset, also selecting the relevant columns
```{r}
averageTimeOnTotal <- averageTimeOn %>% 
  filter(event_description == "Ign OFF") %>% 
  select(vehicleid, time_ON_Sec, distance_KM, average_speed_KMpH)
averageTimeOnTotal
```
#Averaging the data out to be used for clustering analysis
```{r}
averageTimeOnTotalAvg <- averageTimeOnTotal %>% 
  group_by(vehicleid) %>% 
  summarise(time_ON_SecAvg = mean(as.numeric(time_ON_Sec)), distance_KMAvg = mean(as.numeric(distance_KM)), average_speed_KMpHAvg = mean(as.numeric(average_speed_KMpH)))
averageTimeOnTotalAvg
```
#joining the two tables to allow for clustering 

#note may have to remove the vehicle ids, not sure if it will affect the clusters
```{r}
clusterTable <- taxiAnalysis %>% 
  left_join(averageTimeOnTotalAvg, taxiAnalysis, by = "vehicleid")
clusterTable
```
